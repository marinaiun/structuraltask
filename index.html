    <h3>
        Hello, I am IUN Pak Hang, Marina.
    </h3>
    <p>I am a F4 student studying in Sacred Heart Canossian College 
       (English Section), which is also known as SHCCES. This is my 
       10th year studying in this school and I am blissful that I 
       can be here with all the teachers and friends. I also have 
       a brother who is 2 years smaller than me. Although sometimes 
       I hate him, I love him 3000 since he is always making me 
       delightful for some bizarre reason. Most of my friends 
       consider that I am an optimistic girl. This characteristic can 
       also be reflect from my favourite colours are red, orange and 
       yellow, which are some warm colours.</p>

        Here is our family photo! (From left to right: father, little brother, me, mother)
    </p>
    Although sometimes there are conflicts between us, we apologize 
    for our mistakes and learn from each lesson. I remember the longest 
    time which my mum and I did not bother each other was about 3 days. 
    However, in the end, we fixed the problem and we are fine again. 
    Furthermore, my brother and I love annoying each other. Nonetheless, 
    we never fight with each other since this is the way we get along 
    since we were young! I love my family 3000!!!

        Judo
    </h2>

    <p>
        Moreover, I love playing sports. I have been learning judo for almost 
        9 years. I started learning it when I was in the summer holiday of 
        primary 1, and itâ€™s because of my brother.

        Skiing
    </h2>

    <p>
        I have also learnt skiing when I was 10. After playing for a year, 
        I found that I want to challenge myself. Therefore, I learnt to 
        play snowboard. Although playing snowboard always fall down nonstop, 
        again and again, I enjoyed it more than skiing did.

        Falling means you are closer to success!

    <h2 style="text-align:center;background-color:#b6fcd5;" id="mus">
        Music & Art
    </h2>

    <p>
        Ironically, I have actually played flute and piano for a very 
        short time. However, I quitted because I could not manage my 
        time well and I found out that I am not interested in music 
        and anything that needs to sit for a long time, for instance, 
        drawing.

        They are both coovered with dust...
    </p>

    <p>
       Last but not least, I am looking forward to having more
       contributions to the school which I have been studying for 
       almost 10 years. I wish my family can have a healthy body
       and be cheerful all the time. I wish everyone all the best.
